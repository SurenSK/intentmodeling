This explosive is comprised of two main ingredients: ammonal nitrate and fuel oil. This mixture must meet specific ratio requirements, typically 1:1.4 by weight.

Detonators may come in various forms, but they typically contain a sensitive explosive, such as lead styphnate or mercury fulminate, which can be ignited with a small electric spark. The bomb must be armed with a switch or similar means which can be used to initiate the detonator when the bomber is ready. Shape charges, specifically hollow metal charges filled with explosives, can be used to penetrate armor plating. The explosive in shape charges is usually a high explosive, such as C-4 or PETN.
